1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura
- Calculate the average of the energy, valence, and danceability of the 100 songs on the list and then enter those data into a classifier algorithm that will output an audio aura
2. Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
- Audio aura may be influenced by the time of the day that the person listens to the music, hence multiple audio auras can be determined for each time period during the day.
